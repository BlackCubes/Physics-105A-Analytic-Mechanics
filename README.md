# Physics-105A-Analytic-Mechanics

What's up everyone! This is a physics course which is title "PHYSICS 105A: Analytic Mechanics" held at UCLA which I took as an undergraduate.

The course description is such that it involves Newtonian mechanics and conservation laws, gravitational potentials, calculus of variations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, central force motion, linear and nonlinear oscillations. It also involves Mathematica as extra homework assignments.

Please do look through some of the folders which have the assignment homeworks in PDF given from the teacher to complete, and my assignments in Mathematica file.

Any questions or comments are highly appreciated! Thanks, and enjoy looking through my files!
