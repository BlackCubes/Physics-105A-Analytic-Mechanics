/* MATHEMATICA HW 3 */

What's up everyone!

This here was my third assignment which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105A). We explored Bungee Jumping, a pendulum is constructed by attaching a mass m to an extensionless string of length L, and a point-mass m is bound to another point mass M by gravity.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw03' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
