/* MATHEMATICA HW 2 */

What's up everyone!

This here was my first assignment (or second...my teacher never gave us the first) which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105A). We explored ODEs, under-damped mass-spring system, double-pendulum system, and a pair of masses on a frictionless table.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw02' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
