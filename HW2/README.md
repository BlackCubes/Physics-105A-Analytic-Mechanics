/* MATHEMATICA HW 2 */

What's up everyone!

This here was my first assignment (or second...my teacher never gave us the first) which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105A). We explored ODEs, under-damped mass-spring system, double-pendulum system, and a pair of masses on a frictionless table

It was coded using Python as well as using the Jupyter Notebook. There are two files under python file (.py) and jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Two more files are also provided which are in pdf format: The PDF file 'project_1' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform, and the 'blackcubes_Project-1' is my one-column lab report written in LaTex.
