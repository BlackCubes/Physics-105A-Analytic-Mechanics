# MATHEMATICA HW 3

What's up everyone!

This here was my third assignment which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105A). We explored Bungee Jumping, a pendulum, and a point-mass is bound to another point mass by gravity.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw03' is the description of the homework assignment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
