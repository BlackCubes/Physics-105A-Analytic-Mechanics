/* MATHEMATICA HW 4 */

What's up everyone!

This here was my fourth assignment which I did for my Analytic Mechanics class (PHYS 105A). We explored by finding the gravitational potential due to a uniform sphere for all points inside and outside of the sphere as well as animating the orbits, finding the gravitational self- energy of a spherical distribution of mass for which the mass density varies, calculating the potential due to a thin circular ring, and using Lagrangian Dynamics to plot the orbital trajectory for a particle with potential energy.

It was coded using Mathematica. There is a Mathematica file '.nb' which I did, and a PDF file 'hw04' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform.
